To create a PostgreSQL extension, you need at least two files:

-   A control file, which tells PostgreSQL some basic information about the extension, such as its name, version, and schema.
-   A SQL script file, which contains the SQL commands to create the extension's objects.

The control file must be named `extension_name.control` and placed in the `SHAREDIR/extension` directory. The SQL script file must be named `extension--version.sql` and can be placed in the same directory as the control file or in a different directory specified in the control file.

The control file contains the following information:

-   The extension name.
-   The extension version.
-   The schema in which to install the extension's objects.
-   The author of the extension.
-   A description of the extension.

The SQL script file contains the SQL commands to create the extension's objects. These objects can include functions, data types, operators, and index support methods.

Once you have created the control file and the SQL script file, you can use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to load the extension into your PostgreSQL database.

Here is an example of a control file for a PostgreSQL extension called `my_extension`:

```control
extension_name = my_extension
version = 1.0
schema = public
author = Bard
description = This extension provides a new function called `my_function`.

```

Here is an example of a SQL script file for the `my_extension` extension:

```sql

CREATE FUNCTION my_function(text)
RETURNS text
AS
$func$
SELECT 'Hello, ' || $1;
$func$ LANGUAGE sql;

```

Once you have created the control file and the SQL script file, you can load the extension into your PostgreSQL database using the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION my_extension;

```

After the extension has been loaded, you can use the `my_function` function in your PostgreSQL queries. For example, the following query will return the string "Hello, World":


``` sql
SELECT my_function('World');

```
