To develop a Postgres extension, you will need the following software and tools:

1.  PostgreSQL Database Server:

    -   Install the PostgreSQL database server, which will serve as the foundation for developing and testing your extension.
    -   Download the appropriate version of PostgreSQL for your operating system from the official PostgreSQL website (<https://www.postgresql.org/download/>).
2.  Development Environment:

    -   Choose a development environment based on your target language. Here are some common options:
        -   C/C++: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains CLion.
        -   Python: Utilize an IDE such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
        -   Other languages: Select an IDE or editor suitable for your preferred language (e.g., Java - IntelliJ IDEA, Ruby - RubyMine, etc.).
3.  Compiler and Build Tools:

    -   C/C++: Install a C/C++ compiler, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang, based on your operating system.
    -   Python: Ensure that the Python development environment is set up with the required packages and dependencies.
    -   Other languages: Install the necessary compiler or interpreter for your chosen language.
4.  PostgreSQL Development Libraries:

    -   Install the PostgreSQL development libraries to access the necessary headers and libraries required for extension development.
    -   These libraries are typically available as a separate package and should match the version of PostgreSQL you have installed.
5.  Extension Building Tools:

    -   Make: Ensure that the "make" utility is available on your system. It is commonly used for building and compiling extensions.
    -   CMake: If you prefer using CMake for building your extension, make sure it is installed.
6.  Version Control System (optional):

    -   Consider using a version control system like Git to track your extension's source code and manage collaboration if you are working in a team.
7.  Documentation and Resources:

    -   Familiarize yourself with the official PostgreSQL documentation, which provides detailed information on extension development, APIs, and best practices.
    -   Explore online resources, tutorials, and community forums that can provide additional guidance and support.

It's important to note that the specific tools and software required may vary depending on the target language and development environment you choose. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and development tools installed to facilitate smooth extension development for your selected language.
