# MVP (SQL+Control+Makefile):
A basic tutorial on creating a PostgreSQL extension using the bare minimum files and a Makefile:

- A **control file**, which tells PostgreSQL some basic information about the extension, such as its name, version, and schema.
- A **SQL script file**, which contains the SQL commands to create the extension's objects.
- A **Makefile** it is an optional but highly recommended file that helps automate the build process of the extension. It defines the compilation and installation steps, making it easier to build and install the extension on different systems.

## A Postgres extension using only a control file, an SQL file and a Makrfile:

### Step 1: Create the Extension Directory
- Create a directory for your extension. Let's call it "extension".
```
$ mkdir extension
$ cd extension
```

### Step 2: Create the Extension Control File
- Inside the "extension" directory, create a file named "extension.control". 
  - This file defines the metadata and dependencies of your extension.

```
$ touch extension.control
```

- Open the "extension.control" file and add the following content:

```
# myextension.control
comment = 'My PostgreSQL Extension'
default_version = '1.0'
module_pathname = '$libdir/extension
```

### Step 3: Create the Extension SQL File
- Create a file named "extension--1.0.sql".
  - This file contains the SQL statements required to install or uninstall your extension.

```
$ touch myextension--1.0.sql
```

- Open the "extension--1.0.sql" file and add the following content:

```sql
-- extension--1.0.sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS extension;
```

### Step 4: Create the Makefile
- Create a Makefile in the "extension" directory. 
  - The Makefile is used to define the build process. It specifies the module name, object files, extension name, and SQL files. The PG_CONFIG variable retrieves the path to the pg_config utility, which is used to get the necessary configuration for building the extension.

```
$ touch Makefile
```
- Open the Makefile and add the following content:



```makefile
MODULE_big = extension
OBJS = extension.o

EXTENSION = extension
DATA = extension--1.0.sql

PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)

extension.o: extension.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c extension.c -o extension.o
```

- This Makefile defines the necessary build rules to compile the `extension.c` file and generate the `extension.o` object file.
- In the Makefile, replace "extension" with the name of your extension. If you have multiple source files, update the "OBJS" variable accordingly.

### Step 5: Create the C Source File
- Create a file named `extension.c` and add the following code:

```c
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(my_extension_function);

Datum my_extension_function(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) {
    // Function logic goes here
    PG_RETURN_NULL();
}
```

This code defines a simple extension function `my_extension_function` that does not perform any operations and returns `NULL`.

<!-- 
ISSUE 1:
Ran into an issue:
make: *** No rule to make target `extension.o', needed by `extension.so'.  Stop.
The error message you encountered suggests that the Makefile is unable to find the required `extension.o` file. This file is typically generated by compiling the C source code for your extension. To resolve this issue, you need to provide the necessary C source code and update the Makefile accordingly.

```makefile
MODULE_big = myextension
OBJS = extension.o

EXTENSION = myextension
DATA = myextension--1.0.sql

PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
```
- FIX: Update the Makefile to include the `extension.c` file and compile it.
C-file code
```c
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(my_extension_function);

Datum my_extension_function(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) {
    // Function logic goes here
    PG_RETURN_NULL();
}
-->

<!-- 
ISSUE 2:
Ran into an issue:
Makefile:12: *** missing separator.  Stop.
The error message you encountered indicates a formatting issue in the Makefile. Specifically, it suggests that there is a missing separator in line 12 of the Makefile. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the Makefile is properly formatted with correct indentation and separators.

```makefile
MODULE_big = extension
OBJS = extension.o

EXTENSION = extension
DATA = extension--1.0.sql

PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)

extension.o: extension.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c extension.c -o extension.o
```
- FIX: In this updated Makefile, the line containing the build rule for `extension.o` is indented with a tab character (not spaces) before the `$(CC)` command. Make sure to use a tab character for indentation as spaces can cause issues.
-->


### Step 6: Build and Install the Extension
- To build and install the extension, run the following commands:

```
$ make
$ make install
```
- The "make" command compiles the extension code using the Makefile
- The "make install" command copies the necessary files to the appropriate PostgreSQL directories.

### Step 7: Create the Extension in PostgreSQL
- Connect to your PostgreSQL database and execute the following SQL statement to create the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION extension;
```

- The CREATE EXTENSION statement is executed in PostgreSQL to create the extension.

Congratulations! You have created and installed a basic PostgreSQL extension.
