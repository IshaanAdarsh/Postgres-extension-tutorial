A step-by-step tutorial on how to create a sample PostgreSQL extension using Python. We'll cover creating the extension, writing the necessary code, and installing it in a PostgreSQL database.

Step 1: Set up your development environment
Before we start, ensure that you have the following software installed:

- PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
- Python: Install Python and pip, the Python package installer.

Step 2: Create a new directory for your extension
Create a new directory to contain your extension files. For this tutorial, let's assume the directory name is "my_extension".

Step 3: Write the Python code
Inside the "my_extension" directory, create a new Python file named "my_extension.py". This file will contain the code for your extension.

```python
# my_extension.py
import psycopg2

def my_extension_function():
    # Connect to the PostgreSQL database
    conn = psycopg2.connect(database="your_database", user="your_username", password="your_password", host="your_host", port="your_port")
    cur = conn.cursor()

    # Execute a SQL query
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")

    # Fetch the results
    rows = cur.fetchall()
    for row in rows:
        print(row)

    # Close the database connection
    cur.close()
    conn.close()
```

In this example, we use the psycopg2 library to connect to the PostgreSQL database and execute a query. Modify the connection parameters to match your database configuration.

Step 4: Create the extension control file
Create a file named "my_extension.control" inside the "my_extension" directory. This file will define the properties of your extension.

```
# my_extension.control
comment = 'My PostgreSQL Extension'
default_version = '1.0'
module_pathname = '$libdir/my_extension'
```

Ensure that the `module_pathname` points to the location where the PostgreSQL extension will be installed. In this case, it is set to "$libdir/my_extension", which is a placeholder that will be replaced during installation.

Step 5: Create the SQL script
Create a file named "my_extension--1.0.sql" inside the "my_extension" directory. This script will define the SQL commands to install and uninstall the extension.

```
-- my_extension--1.0.sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_extension_function() RETURNS VOID AS '$libdir/my_extension', 'my_extension_function' LANGUAGE C STRICT;
```

Step 6: Build and install the extension
Now, we'll compile the Python code into a shared library and install the extension in the PostgreSQL database.

6.1: Create the Makefile
Create a file named "Makefile" inside the "my_extension" directory. This Makefile will define the compilation and installation instructions.

```Makefile
EXTENSION = my_extension
DATA = my_extension--1.0.sql

PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
```

Ensure that the `PG_CONFIG` variable points to the correct location of the `pg_config` executable.

6.2: Build the extension
Open a terminal, navigate to the "my_extension" directory, and run the following command to build the extension:

```bash
make
```

This command will compile the Python code into a shared library.

6.3: Install the extension
Once the compilation is successful, run the following command to install the extension in the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
make install
```

This command will copy the shared library, control file, and SQL script to the appropriate PostgreSQL directories.

Step 7: Load the extension in PostgreSQL
To start using the extension, you need to load

 it into your PostgreSQL database.

7.1: Connect to the PostgreSQL database
Connect to your PostgreSQL database using any PostgreSQL client or command-line tool.

7.2: Load the extension
Run the following SQL command to load the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION my_extension;
```

This command will load the extension and make its functions available for use.

Step 8: Test the extension
Now that the extension is installed, you can test it by executing the function defined in the Python code.

```sql
SELECT my_extension_function();
```

This query will execute the `my_extension_function` and display the results.

That's it! You have successfully created and installed a PostgreSQL extension using Python. You can further enhance the extension by adding more functions and features to meet your requirements.
