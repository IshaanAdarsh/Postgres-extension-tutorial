## Usage

Once the `pg_sample_ext` extension is installed and upgraded to version 1.0.1, you can use the included functions and new features in your SQL queries.

### square

The `square` function calculates the square of a number.

```
SELECT square(5);  -- Returns 25
```

### Composite Type (person_type): 
- The extension now includes a composite type named `person_type` that represents a person's name and age. This allows for more structured data storage and retrieval.
- Insert a row with a value from the composite type

```
INSERT INTO my_table (person) VALUES (('John Doe', 30));
```


### Enumerated Type (status_type):
- A new enumerated type called `status_type` is introduced, which provides a predefined set of values for representing different statuses. This enhances data integrity and enables more meaningful data classification.
- Insert a row with a value from the enumerated type

```
INSERT INTO status_table (status) VALUES ('active');
```

### Domain Type (positive_integer): 
- The extension now includes a domain type called `positive_integer`, which is a specialized data type that represents positive integers. This allows for better constraint enforcement and data validation.
- Insert a row, ensuring the quantity is a positive integer

```
INSERT INTO quant_table (quantity) VALUES (10);
```

###  Custom Operator (@*):
- The extension introduces a custom operator `@*` that performs a custom operation, such as multiplication, on values of a specific type.
-- It multiplies two values of type my_type and returns a value of the same type.

```
SELECT ROW(2)::my_type @* ROW(3)::my_type AS result;
```
