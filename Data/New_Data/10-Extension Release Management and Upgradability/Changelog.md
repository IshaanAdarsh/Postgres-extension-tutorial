## Changelog:
Maintaining a changelog is an essential practice in extension release management. A changelog is a file that provides a comprehensive and organized list of changes, enhancements, and bug fixes for each release of your PostgreSQL extension. It serves as a communication tool between you and the users, helping them understand the modifications made and the impact they may have on their existing installations. Here's a detailed explanation of how to maintain a changelog and an example code snippet:

1. Changelog Format: The changelog is typically written in a human-readable format, such as Markdown or plain text. It consists of a list of entries, with each entry corresponding to a specific release. Each entry includes the release version, release date, and a description of the changes made.

2. Structure of Changelog Entry: A typical changelog entry includes the following information:

   - Version: The version number of the release (following the semantic versioning scheme).
   - Release Date: The date when the release was made.
   - Added: A list of new features or functionalities added in the release.
   - Changed: Any modifications or enhancements made to existing features.
   - Fixed: Bug fixes or issues resolved in the release.
   - Deprecated: Features that are marked as deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
   - Removed: Features or functionalities that have been removed in the release.
   - Security: Any security-related changes or updates.

Here's an example of a changelog entry:

```markdown
## [1.0.0] - 2023-05-12

### Added
- Implemented feature X to enhance functionality.
- Added support for additional data types.

### Changed
- Refactored function Y for improved performance.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue with function Z returning incorrect results.
- Fixed a bug causing a crash in certain scenarios.
```

In this example, the changelog entry corresponds to version 1.0.0 of the extension. It includes the release date, followed by separate sections for added features, changed functionality, and fixed issues.

As you release new versions of your extension, you should update the changelog accordingly, providing a clear and concise summary of the changes made in each release. Maintaining an updated and detailed changelog helps users understand the evolution of the extension, track the modifications that have been made, and assess the impact on their existing installations. It also facilitates effective communication with users, demonstrating your commitment to transparency and continuous improvement.

Remember to include the changelog file in your extension's repository and make it easily accessible to users.
