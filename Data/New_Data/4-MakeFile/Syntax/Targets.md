Targets in a Makefile represent files or actions that need to be built or executed. They define the tasks that the Makefile will perform. Here are some common targets used in a Makefile for a PostgreSQL extension:

1.  **all**: This is the default target that is typically used to build the entire extension. It can depend on other targets, such as `build` or `install`, to perform necessary tasks.

2.  **build**: This target is responsible for compiling the extension's source code and generating the necessary artifacts, such as object files or shared libraries.

3.  **install**: The `install` target is used to install the extension into the PostgreSQL installation. It typically copies the built files to the appropriate directories, registers the extension in the database, and sets up any required permissions.

4.  **clean**: The `clean` target is used to clean up the generated files and artifacts from the build process. It removes object files, executables, and any other generated files, allowing for a fresh build.

5.  **test**: This target is used to run regression tests for the extension. It executes the test cases defined in the regression test suite and verifies that the extension functions as expected.

6.  **uninstall**: The `uninstall` target is used to remove the extension from the PostgreSQL installation. It reverses the steps performed during the `install` target, removing the extension's files and unregistering it from the database.

### Code snippets explaining each target:

```makefile
# Target: build
# Builds the extension shared library
build: my_extension.so

my_extension.so: my_extension.o helper.o
    gcc -shared -o my_extension.so my_extension.o helper.o

my_extension.o: my_extension.c
    gcc -c -o my_extension.o my_extension.c

helper.o: helper.c
    gcc -c -o helper.o helper.c

# Target: sql
# Generates the SQL script file
sql: my_extension.sql

my_extension.sql: my_extension.sql.in
    sed 's/@@VERSION@@/1.0/g' my_extension.sql.in > my_extension.sql

# Target: test
# Runs the regression tests
test: test_my_extension

test_my_extension:
    psql -d my_database -f regression/test_my_extension.sql

# Target: install
# Installs the extension in the PostgreSQL database
install: build
    cp my_extension.so /usr/lib/postgresql/12/lib/
    psql -d my_database -c "CREATE EXTENSION my_extension"

# Target: uninstall
# Uninstalls the extension from the PostgreSQL database
uninstall:
    psql -d my_database -c "DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS my_extension"

# Target: clean
# Cleans the build artifacts
clean:
    rm -f my_extension.so my_extension.o helper.o my_extension.sql


```

In this example, we have the following targets:

-   `build`: This target builds the extension shared library `my_extension.so`. It depends on `my_extension.o` and `helper.o` and uses the `gcc` command to create the shared library.
    
-   `my_extension.o` and `helper.o`: These targets compile the `my_extension.c` and `helper.c` source files into object files. They use the `gcc` command with the `-c` flag to compile the code.
    
-   `sql`: This target generates the SQL script file `my_extension.sql`. It depends on `my_extension.sql.in` and uses the `sed` command to replace placeholders with specific values.
    
-   `test`: This target runs the regression tests for the extension. It executes the SQL script `regression/test_my_extension.sql` using the `psql` command.
    
-   `install`: This target installs the extension in the PostgreSQL database. It depends on the `build` target and copies the `my_extension.so` file to the appropriate directory. It then executes the SQL command to create the extension in the database.
    
-   `uninstall`: This target uninstalls the extension from the PostgreSQL database. It executes the SQL command to drop the extension if it exists.
    
-   `clean`: This target cleans the build artifacts by removing the shared library, object files, and generated SQL script.
