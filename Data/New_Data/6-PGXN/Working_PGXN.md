# Working of PGXN:
To set up and use PGXN to publish and distribute your extension to other users, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Set up a PGXN Account:** Visit the PGXN website (<https://pgxn.org/>) and create an account. This will allow you to manage your extensions and publish them on the PGXN repository.

2.  **Prepare Your Extension:** Ensure that your extension is properly developed, tested, and ready for distribution. Make sure you have a well-documented README file, SQL scripts, and any necessary code files or dependencies. 

3.  **Create a PGXN Metadata File:** PGXN requires a metadata file that provides information about your extension. Create a file named `META.json` (or `META.yml`) that includes details such as the extension name, version, author, description, dependencies, and other relevant information. Refer to the PGXN documentation for the required format and fields.

4.  **Build a Distribution Package:** Package your extension and the `META.json` file into a distribution package. This package should be in a compressed format (e.g., tar.gz) and include all the necessary files for installation and usage of your extension.

5.  **Publish Your Extension:** Use the PGXN command-line tool or web interface to publish your extension. Provide the distribution package created in the previous step and upload it to PGXN. The tool will validate the package and extract the metadata.

6.  **Validate and Approve:** The PGXN administrators will review your extension to ensure it meets the quality and submission requirements. They may provide feedback or request changes if necessary. Once approved, your extension will be available for others to download and use.

7.  **Share and Distribute:** Once your extension is published on PGXN, you can share the link with others or promote it through appropriate channels. Users can discover and install your extension using PGXN command-line tools or by manually downloading and installing the distribution package.

8.  **Update and Maintain Your Extension:** As you make updates or release new versions of your extension, repeat the steps above to update the metadata, create a new distribution package, and publish the updated version on PGXN. This allows users to easily track and upgrade to the latest version.

By using PGXN, you can leverage its infrastructure and community support to efficiently publish and distribute your PostgreSQL extension to a wider audience. It provides a centralized platform for users to discover, evaluate, and install your extension, helping you reach a broader user base and contribute to the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

# Using PGXN for Extension Installation:

To install a PostgreSQL extension using PGXN, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Install PGXN Client:** Before using PGXN for extension installation, you need to have the PGXN client installed on your system. You can install it using the following command:
    
    ```ruby
    $ cpanm App::pgxnclient
    ```
    
    Make sure you have Perl and CPAN installed on your system before running the above command.
    
2.  **Search for the Extension:** Use the `pgxn search` command to search for the extension you want to install. For example, to search for the "my\_extension" extension, run the following command:
    
  ```ruby
   $ pgxn search my_extension
   ```
    
    This will display a list of matching extensions along with their descriptions and authors.
    
3. **Install the Extension:** Once you have identified the extension you want to install, use the `pgxn install` command to install it. For example, to install the "my\_extension" extension, run the following command:
    
    ```ruby
    $ pgxn install my_extension
    ```
    
    This command will fetch the extension from the PGXN repository, download the distribution package, extract it, and install the extension in your PostgreSQL installation.
    
4.  **Enable the Extension:** After the installation is complete, you need to enable the extension in your PostgreSQL database. Connect to your database using an appropriate client (e.g., `psql`) and run the following SQL command:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION my_extension;
    ```
    
    This command will enable the "my\_extension" extension in the current database.
    
5.  **Verify the Installation:** You can verify that the extension is successfully installed by running SQL queries or commands specific to the extension. Refer to the extension's documentation for usage instructions and examples.
    

By using PGXN for extension installation, you can easily discover, download, and install extensions from the PGXN repository. The PGXN client automates the process of fetching the extension, handling dependencies, and integrating it into your PostgreSQL installation. This simplifies the installation workflow and ensures that extensions are installed correctly and consistently.
