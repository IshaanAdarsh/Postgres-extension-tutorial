## Writing Functions and Stored Procedures: 
Functions and stored procedures are essential components of a PostgreSQL extension. They allow you to define custom behavior and perform operations on the database data. Here's a quick start on how to write functions and stored procedures in PostgreSQL extensions:

1.  **Select a Procedural Language:** Choose a procedural language supported by PostgreSQL that best suits your needs, such as PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Perl, PL/Java, or others.
    
2.  **Define a Function:** Use the chosen procedural language to define a function. Functions in PostgreSQL are created using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement. Specify the function name, input parameters, return type, and the function's body, which contains the logic to be executed.
    

Example (using PL/pgSQL):

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_name(emp_id integer) RETURNS text AS $$
DECLARE
    employee_name text;
BEGIN
    SELECT name INTO employee_name FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
    RETURN employee_name;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

3.  **Use Stored Procedures:** Stored procedures are similar to functions but don't have a return value. They are commonly used to perform actions or modify data in the database.

Example (using PL/pgSQL):

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE update_employee_salary(emp_id integer, new_salary numeric) AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary WHERE id = emp_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

4.  **Interact with PostgreSQL Data:** Inside the function or stored procedure, you can interact with the PostgreSQL data using SQL statements. Use `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to read or modify data as needed. You can also use variables, control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), and exception handling to enhance the functionality of your functions and stored procedures.

Example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_count() RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    count_emp integer;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO count_emp FROM employees;
    RETURN count_emp;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Using Procedural Language Functions in Extensions: 
Once you have written functions and stored procedures in a procedural language, you can incorporate them into your PostgreSQL extension. To do this:

1.  Include the procedural language code files in your extension's source code.
    
2.  Make sure the procedural language is properly enabled in the target database by following the steps mentioned earlier.
    
3.  Include the necessary SQL statements in your extension's SQL script file to create the functions and stored procedures using the `CREATE FUNCTION` and `CREATE PROCEDURE` commands.
    
4.  Build and install the extension using the provided Makefile or other build tools.
    
5.  Once the extension is installed, the functions and stored procedures will be available for use in the database. You can call them like any other built-in or user-defined function.
    

## Interaction with PostgreSQL Data: 
When writing functions and stored procedures, you can interact with PostgreSQL data using SQL statements. Use `SELECT` statements to retrieve data from tables, `INSERT` statements to add new data, `UPDATE` statements to modify existing data, and `DELETE` statements to remove data.

You can use variables within your functions and stored procedures to store intermediate results, perform calculations, or manipulate data. You can also use control structures like loops and conditionals to implement complex logic.

Here's an example of a function that uses a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_name(emp_id integer) RETURNS text AS $$
DECLARE
    employee_name text;
BEGIN
    SELECT name INTO employee_name FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
    RETURN employee_name;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this function, the `SELECT` statement retrieves the name of an employee with a specified ID and stores it in the `employee_name` variable. The variable is then returned as the result of the function.

By combining procedural language functions with SQL statements, you can create powerful and flexible extensions that interact with PostgreSQL data in various ways.
