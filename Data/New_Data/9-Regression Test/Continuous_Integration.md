Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves regularly integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. In the context of regression testing for a PostgreSQL extension, integrating the tests into a CI system ensures that tests are automatically executed whenever code changes are made, providing early detection of regressions. Here's a detailed explanation of how to set up CI for regression testing and provide code snippets for illustration:

1. Choose a CI System: Select a CI system that integrates well with your development workflow and supports running PostgreSQL regression tests. Popular CI systems include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD.

2. Configure CI Pipeline: Set up a CI pipeline that includes the necessary steps for building, installing, and running the regression tests for your PostgreSQL extension. This typically involves specifying the build environment, dependencies, and test execution commands. Here's an example configuration file for a PostgreSQL extension using Travis CI:

   ```yaml
   # .travis.yml

   language: c

   # PostgreSQL version to test against
   env:
     - PGVERSION=13

   # Build and test stages
   stages:
     - build
     - test

   # Build stage
   jobs:
     include:
       - stage: build
         before_script:
           - sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-$PGVERSION
         script:
           - make

   # Test stage
   jobs:
     include:
       - stage: test
         before_script:
           - sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-$PGVERSION
         script:
           - make install
           - make installcheck
   ```

   In this example, the CI pipeline is divided into two stages: `build` and `test`. In the `build` stage, the extension is built, and in the `test` stage, the extension is installed and regression tests are executed using `make installcheck`.

3. Define CI Hooks: Set up hooks or triggers that automatically trigger the CI pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the version control repository. This ensures that the regression tests are executed on every code change, providing continuous feedback on the extension's stability.

4. Monitor CI Results: Monitor the results of the CI pipeline to identify any failures or regressions. CI systems typically provide detailed logs and reports, highlighting the specific test cases that failed. Ensure that failure notifications are sent to the relevant stakeholders, so issues can be addressed promptly.

By integrating regression tests into a CI system, you can automate the execution of tests and gain early feedback on the extension's stability. CI systems provide a seamless integration with version control repositories and enable developers to catch regressions quickly, allowing for timely fixes and maintaining the quality of the PostgreSQL extension.
