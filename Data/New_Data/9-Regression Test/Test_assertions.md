## Test assertions
Test assertions are critical in validating the behavior and correctness of a PostgreSQL extension during regression testing. Here's a detailed explanation of how to define assertions and provide code snippets for illustration:

1. Identify Expected Outcomes: For each test case, determine the expected outcome or result that the extension should produce. This could be a specific value, a set of records, or the absence of certain data.

2. Define Assertions: Write assertions in the form of SQL queries or code statements that compare the actual results with the expected outcomes. Assertions help validate whether the extension behaves as intended. Here are a few examples of test assertions:

   - Asserting Specific Values:

     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) = 3 FROM users;
     -- Asserts that there are exactly 3 rows in the 'users' table

     SELECT name = 'John Doe' FROM users WHERE id = 1;
     -- Asserts that the name of the user with id 1 is 'John Doe'
     ```

   - Asserting Record Sets:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= 18;
     -- Asserts that all returned records have an age greater than or equal to 18

     SELECT COUNT(*) = 0 FROM products WHERE price < 0;
     -- Asserts that there are no products with a negative price
     ```

   - Asserting Exceptions or Errors:

     ```sql
     BEGIN;
     -- Perform an operation that should raise an exception or error
     SELECT pg_typeof(1 / 0) = 'text';
     -- Asserts that dividing by zero raises a division by zero error
     ROLLBACK;
     ```

3. Check Assertions: Execute the assertions after performing the test operations and compare the actual results with the expected outcomes. If the assertion evaluates to true, the test passes. Otherwise, it indicates a regression or unexpected behavior that needs investigation.

4. Reporting Assertion Failures: Ensure that the test framework or test runner reports failures or exceptions when an assertion fails. This helps identify which specific test case failed and provides details for debugging.

By defining and implementing test assertions, you can verify that the extension produces the expected outcomes and behaves correctly under different scenarios. Assertions provide a mechanism for automated testing and help detect regressions, ensuring the extension's reliability and stability.
