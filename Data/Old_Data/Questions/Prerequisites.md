## Prerequisites for Writing an Extension

Before you can start writing a PostgreSQL extension, you'll need to make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. PostgreSQL

First and foremost, you'll need to have PostgreSQL installed on your system. You can download the latest version of PostgreSQL from the official website at [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) .
### 2. Target Language

You'll also need to have knowledge of the programming language you're planning to use for your extension. PostgreSQL supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, and more. Choose a language that you're comfortable with and that's appropriate for your extension's purpose.
### 3. Build Tools

You'll need to have the appropriate build tools installed on your system in order to compile your extension. The exact tools you need will depend on your chosen programming language, but in general, you'll need a compiler and linker that are compatible with your PostgreSQL installation.
### 4. PostgreSQL Development Headers

You'll need to have the PostgreSQL development headers installed on your system in order to write an extension. These headers provide the necessary interfaces for communicating with PostgreSQL and are typically included with the PostgreSQL installation. Make sure you have the appropriate version of the headers for your PostgreSQL installation.
### 5. PostgreSQL Server Configuration

You'll need to make sure that your PostgreSQL server is configured to allow the installation and use of extensions. This typically involves setting the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter to the name of your extension and restarting the PostgreSQL server. Consult the PostgreSQL documentation for more information on configuring extensions.

### 6. Make and GCC (for C/C++ extensions):

If you plan to write your extension in `C` or `C++`, you will need to have the make and GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) utilities installed on your system.

### 7. Knowledge of the extension API:

In order to write a PostgreSQL extension, you need to have a good understanding of the PostgreSQL extension API. This includes knowing how to define functions, types, and operators, and how to handle errors.
