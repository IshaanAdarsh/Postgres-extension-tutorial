By using the PostgreSQL TAP framework, you can write a single regression test which works for all Postgres extension testing. This can save you a lot of time and effort, as you will not need to write separate regression tests for each extension.

The TAP framework is a standard way of writing and running regression tests for software. It provides a simple way to define tests, run them, and collect the results.

To write a TAP-based regression test for a Postgres extension, you will need to create a file with the .tap extension. This file will contain the following information:

-   A list of the tests to run
-   The expected results of each test

Here are some other ways to write a singular regression test which works for all Postgres extension testing:

-   Use a continuous integration server (CI server) to run the regression tests automatically. This will help you to ensure that the tests are always run and that any regressions are caught quickly.
-   Use a test runner tool to automate the running of the regression tests. This will help you to save time and effort.
-   Use a test data generator to create test data for the regression tests. This will help you to ensure that the tests are comprehensive and that they cover all possible scenarios.
