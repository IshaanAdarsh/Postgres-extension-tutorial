Once you have the prerequisites and resources in place, you can start writing your PostgreSQL extension. The following are some tips for writing a PostgreSQL extension:

-   Start with a plan. What do you want your extension to do? What features do you want it to have?
-   Break your extension down into smaller pieces. This will make it easier to develop and debug.
-   Use the PostgreSQL extension API. The PostgreSQL extension API provides a number of functions and macros that can help you write your extension.
-   Test your extension thoroughly. Make sure that it works as expected.
-   Document your extension. This will make it easier for other people to use your extension.
