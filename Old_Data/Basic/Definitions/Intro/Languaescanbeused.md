    -   Build Tools: PLV8 extensions do not require explicit compilation, but you may need to install the PLV8 extension in your PostgreSQL installation.

7.  Perl:
    -   Development Environment: Perl extensions can be developed using any Perl-supported IDE or text editor, such as Perl IDE, Padre, or Sublime Text.
    -   Build Tools: Perl extensions do not require explicit compilation, but ensure you have the necessary Perl development environment set up with the required modules and dependencies.


8.  PHP:
    -   Development Environment: PHP extensions can be developed using PHP-supported IDEs like PhpStorm, Visual Studio Code with PHP extensions, or Sublime Text with PHP packages.
    -   Build Tools: PHP extensions do not require explicit compilation, but ensure you have the necessary PHP development environment set up.


9.  Tcl:
    -   Development Environment: Tcl extensions can be developed in any text editor or Tcl-supported IDE, such as ActiveTcl, Tcl Dev Kit, or Sublime Text with Tcl packages.
    -   Build Tools: Tcl extensions do not require explicit compilation, but ensure you have the necessary Tcl development environment set up.


10.  PL/Python:
    -   Development Environment: PL/Python extensions, which allow writing Python functions within SQL statements, can be developed in any Python-supported IDE, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook.

11.  R:
    -   Development Environment: R extensions can be developed using any R-supported IDE or text editor, such as RStudio, Jupyter Notebook with R kernel, or Sublime Text with R packages.
    -   Build Tools: R extensions do not require explicit compilation, but ensure you have the necessary R development environment set up with the required packages and dependencies.


12.  Lua:
    -   Development Environment: Lua extensions can be developed in any text editor or Lua-supported IDE, such as ZeroBrane Studio, Visual Studio Code with Lua extensions, or Sublime Text with Lua packages.
    -   Build Tools: Lua extensions do not require explicit compilation, but ensure you have the necessary Lua development environment set up.
    
13.  ODBC:
    -   Development Environment: ODBC extensions allow leveraging the Open Database Connectivity standard to interface with other databases. Development environments for ODBC extensions depend on the language you're using to interact with the ODBC interface.
    -   Build Tools: ODBC extensions may require specific libraries and tools based on the language you choose to develop with. Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up.
    
14.  Java (PL/Java):
    -   Development Environment: Java extensions can be developed using Java-supported IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
