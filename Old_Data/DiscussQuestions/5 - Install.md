The `CREATE EXTENSION` statement is used to register an extension with PostgreSQL. Once an extension is registered, it can be used in PostgreSQL queries.

The syntax of the `CREATE EXTENSION` statement is as follows:

CREATE EXTENSION [ IF NOT EXISTS ] extension_name [ WITH ] [ SCHEMA schema_name ] [ VERSION version ] [ CASCADE ]

- The `extension_name` is the name of the extension.
- The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is optional and can be used to avoid errors if the extension already exists. 
- The `SCHEMA` clause is optional and can be used to specify the schema where the extension should be installed. 
- The `VERSION` clause is optional and can be used to specify the version of the extension. 
- The `CASCADE` clause is optional and can be used to drop objects that depend on the extension if the extension is dropped.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION myextension;
```
Once the extension is created, you can use it in PostgreSQL queries. 

For example, the following query uses the function `my_function` from the `myextension` extension:
```sql
SELECT my_function('ishaan');
```
This query will return the string "Hello, ishaan".
