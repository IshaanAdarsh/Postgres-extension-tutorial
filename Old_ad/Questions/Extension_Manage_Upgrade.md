# Extension Release Management

To manage releases of your PostgreSQL extension, you should follow these steps:

1. **Version your extension.** Choose a version numbering scheme for your extension, such as `major.minor.patch`. For example, `1.0.0` would be the first major release, `1.1.0` would be a minor release with new features, and `1.1.1` would be a patch release with bug fixes.
2. **Create release notes.** Write release notes that describe the changes made in each release. This will help users understand what has changed and what they need to do to upgrade.
3. **Create a changelog.** Create a changelog that documents all changes made to the extension, including bug fixes, new features, and deprecated functionality.
4. **Publish releases.** Publish releases of your extension on a repository or download site, along with the release notes and changelog.
5. **Notify users.** Notify users of new releases via email, social media, or other communication channels.

## Extension Upgradability

To make your PostgreSQL extension upgradable, you should follow these guidelines:

1. **Maintain backward compatibility.** Avoid making breaking changes to your extension's API or behavior. If you need to make a breaking change, provide a migration guide or tool to help users upgrade.
2. **Use semantic versioning.** Use semantic versioning to indicate the nature of changes made in each release. This helps users understand the impact of a new release on their systems.
3. **Provide upgrade scripts.** Provide scripts or tools to help users upgrade from one version of your extension to the next. These scripts should handle any necessary database schema changes, as well as any changes to configuration or other files.
4. **Test upgrades thoroughly.** Test the upgrade process thoroughly to ensure that users can upgrade safely and without data loss.
5. **Document upgrade procedures.** Document the steps required to upgrade your extension, including any dependencies or prerequisites.

By following these guidelines, you can make your PostgreSQL extension easy to upgrade and maintain for your users.
