## Version Compatibility Matrix:
Maintaining a version compatibility matrix for your PostgreSQL extension is essential to inform users about the supported versions of PostgreSQL and any dependencies required for each release. Here's an explanation of how to create a version compatibility matrix and code snippets to illustrate its implementation:

1. Create a Compatibility Matrix: Prepare a table or document that clearly outlines the compatibility between your extension's releases and different versions of PostgreSQL. Include the following information:

   - Extension Version: The version number or release identifier of your extension.
   - PostgreSQL Version: The range of PostgreSQL versions that are supported by the extension release. Specify the minimum and maximum versions, if applicable.
   - Dependency Versions: If your extension relies on specific versions of external libraries or modules, list the dependencies and their corresponding compatible versions.

   Here's an example of a version compatibility matrix:

   ```
   | Extension Version | PostgreSQL Version | Dependency Versions |
   |-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
   | 1.0.0             | 9.6 - 12           | libfoo 2.0.0        |
   | 1.1.0             | 9.6 - 13           | libfoo 2.1.0        |
   | 2.0.0             | 10 - 14            | libfoo 2.2.0        |
   ``` 

2. Include Compatibility Information in Documentation: Incorporate the version compatibility matrix into your extension's documentation. This can be in the form of a dedicated section outlining the supported PostgreSQL versions and dependencies for each release. Clearly communicate the minimum and maximum versions of PostgreSQL that are compatible with each release.

3. Update the Compatibility Matrix: Keep the compatibility matrix up to date with each new release of your extension. Whenever you introduce changes that affect compatibility, ensure that the matrix is updated to reflect the supported versions accurately.

Here's an example of a code snippet showing the version compatibility matrix in Markdown format:

```markdown
## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Extension Version | PostgreSQL Version | Dependency Versions |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1.0.0             | 9.6 - 12           | libfoo 2.0.0        |
| 1.1.0             | 9.6 - 13           | libfoo 2.1.0        |
| 2.0.0             | 10 - 14            | libfoo 2.2.0        |
```

By maintaining a version compatibility matrix, you provide clear information to users about which versions of PostgreSQL are supported by each release of your extension. This helps users make informed decisions about compatibility and ensures a smooth experience when integrating your extension into their PostgreSQL environment.
