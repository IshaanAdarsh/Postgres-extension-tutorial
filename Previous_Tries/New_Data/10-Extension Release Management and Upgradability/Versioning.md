## Versioning:
Versioning is a crucial aspect of extension release management and upgradability. It provides a standardized way to indicate the compatibility, significance, and evolution of different releases of your PostgreSQL extension. Semantic versioning is a widely adopted versioning scheme that consists of three components: MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH. Here's a detailed explanation of versioning and an example code snippet:

1. Major Version (MAJOR): The MAJOR version indicates significant updates that may introduce breaking changes or major new features. Increment the MAJOR version when you make incompatible changes to the extension.

2. Minor Version (MINOR): The MINOR version indicates backwards-compatible additions or enhancements to the extension. Increment the MINOR version when you add new functionality or introduce improvements that do not break existing functionality.

3. Patch Version (PATCH): The PATCH version indicates backwards-compatible bug fixes or minor updates that do not introduce new features or breaking changes. Increment the PATCH version when you make bug fixes, performance improvements, or other minor updates.

Semantic versioning follows the format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to define and use versioning in your PostgreSQL extension:

```c
#define EXTENSION_VERSION "1.0.0"

// Function to retrieve the extension version
Datum extension_version(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    text *version = cstring_to_text(EXTENSION_VERSION);
    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(version);
}
``` 

In this example, the extension version is defined as "1.0.0" using the `EXTENSION_VERSION` macro. The `extension_version` function is a simple example of how you can expose the version information to users. This function can be used to retrieve the version of the extension by executing a query like `SELECT extension_version();` in PostgreSQL.

When releasing new versions of your extension, you should update the version number accordingly based on the nature of the changes. For example, if you introduce a breaking change in functionality, you would increment the MAJOR version. If you add new features, you would increment the MINOR version. And if you make bug fixes or performance improvements, you would increment the PATCH version.

By adhering to a clear and consistent versioning scheme, users of your PostgreSQL extension can easily understand the compatibility and significance of different releases. This helps in managing the upgrade process, communicating changes to users, and ensuring a smooth and predictable experience for users of your extension.
