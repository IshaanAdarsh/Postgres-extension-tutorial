## Test result: 
Test result analysis is an essential step in regression testing for a PostgreSQL extension. It involves analyzing the test results, identifying failures or unexpected behaviors, and taking appropriate actions to debug and fix the issues. Here's a detailed explanation of how to perform test result analysis and provide code snippets for illustration:

1. Test Result Output: Ensure that your regression testing framework provides detailed output of the test results. This may include information such as the number of tests executed, the number of tests passed and failed, and any error messages or stack traces associated with the failed tests.

2. Test Result Logging: Maintain a test log or report that captures the test execution details and results. This log can be in the form of a text file, an HTML report, or any other suitable format. The log should include information such as the test case name, the expected outcome, the actual outcome, and any relevant error messages.

   ```bash
   # Example code snippet for logging test results to a text file

   # Open the log file
   LOG_FILE="test_log.txt"
   touch $LOG_FILE

   # Function to log test results
   log_result() {
     local test_case=$1
     local expected=$2
     local actual=$3
     local result

     # Compare expected and actual results
     if [[ $expected == $actual ]]; then
       result="PASS"
     else
       result="FAIL"
     fi

     # Append the result to the log file
     echo "$test_case | Expected: $expected | Actual: $actual | Result: $result" >> $LOG_FILE
   }

   # Example usage
   log_result "Test Case 1" "Hello" "Hello"   # PASS
   log_result "Test Case 2" "Hello" "World"   # FAIL
   ```

   In this example, a function `log_result` is defined to log the test results to a text file. It takes the test case name, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome as arguments and compares them to determine the result. The results are then appended to the log file.

3. Failure Analysis: Analyze the test results and identify any failures or unexpected behaviors. Examine the failed test cases and the associated error messages or stack traces to understand the nature of the failure. Debug the issues by inspecting the relevant code, data, or configurations.

4. Issue Tracking: If issues are identified during the test result analysis, it is recommended to track them using an issue tracking system or a bug tracking tool. Create new issues or link them to existing issues for proper tracking, assignment, and resolution. This helps ensure that all identified issues are properly addressed and tracked over time.

Test result analysis is crucial for identifying and addressing any failures or unexpected behaviors in the extension. By maintaining a test log or report and performing thorough analysis, developers can gain insights into the extension's behavior, detect regressions, and take the necessary steps to improve the quality and stability of the PostgreSQL extension.
