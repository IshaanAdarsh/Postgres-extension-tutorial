# Procedural languages:
Procedural languages in PostgreSQL provide a powerful way to extend the database's functionality by writing functions and procedures in languages other than SQL. These are natively supported by PostgreSQL and can be used directly within the database environment. These languages, also known as PL languages, offer developers the flexibility to implement complex business logic and computations directly within the database.

Key points about procedural languages in PostgreSQL:

1. **Extended Functionality:** Procedural languages enable developers to write custom functions and procedures in languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, PL/R, and more. This allows for the creation of complex computations and data processing within the database.

2. **Control Flow and Logic:** Procedural languages offer control flow constructs like loops, conditionals, and exception handling, making it easier to implement business logic that goes beyond the capabilities of SQL.

3. **Custom Aggregates and Window Functions:** Procedural languages allow developers to define custom aggregates and window functions, enabling advanced data analysis and processing directly within the database.

4. **Performance Optimization:** By choosing the right procedural language for specific tasks, developers can achieve performance improvements over SQL, especially for complex data operations.

To use procedural languages in PostgreSQL:

1. **Enable the Language:** Before using a procedural language in a database, it needs to be enabled using the `CREATE LANGUAGE` command or by installing the relevant extensions.

2. **Write Functions and Procedures:** After enabling the language, developers can write functions and stored procedures using the chosen procedural language. This allows them to implement complex business logic, data transformations, and data analysis directly within the database.

## Quick Start: Creating a Postgres Extension using PL/Python:

In this quick start guide, we will create a simple PostgreSQL extension using [PL/Python](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html). The extension will include a Python function to add two numbers.

## Prerequisites

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running on your system.
- [plpython3u]((https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html)) procedural language available in your PostgreSQL installation.
- Basic knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org) programming.

### Step 1: Create the Extension Directory

Create a new directory for your extension project. You can choose any location on your system. Let's assume you create the directory in your home folder:

```bash
mkdir ~/pg_py_ext
cd ~/pg_py_ext
```

### Step 2: Create the SQL Script File (pg_py_ext--1.0.sql)

Next, we'll create the SQL script file that defines the extension's functions and features. Create a file named `pg_py_ext--1.0.sql` in the `pg_py_ext` directory with the following content:

```sql
-- pg_py_ext--1.0.sql
-- Create the function that uses the Python script
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_numbers(a integer, b integer)
RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE plpython3u
AS $$
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
return add_numbers(int(a), int(b))
$$;
```

#### Explanation of the SQL Script:
- `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_numbers(a integer, b integer) RETURNS integer LANGUAGE plpython3u AS $$`: This statement creates the function `add_numbers` with two integer arguments (`a` and `b`). The function will return an integer. The `LANGUAGE plpython3u` specifies that the function is written in PL/Python3U.
- `def add_numbers(a, b):`: This is the Python code block that defines the `add_numbers` function. The function takes two arguments (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum.

### Step 3: Create the Control File:
```control
# pg_py_ext.control

# Extension name
comment = 'A simple PostgreSQL extension using PL/Python3U.'

# Default version of the extension
default_version = '1.0'

# Extension is relocatable
relocatable = true
```
- For more detailed information on Control Files, you can refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation on Control Files](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#id-1.8.3.20.11).

#### Explanation of the Control File:
- `comment = 'A simple PostgreSQL extension using PL/Python3U.'`: This line provides a brief description or comment about the extension.
- `default_version = '1.0'`: This line specifies the default version of the extension.
- `relocatable = true`: This line indicates that the extension is relocatable, allowing it to be moved to a different location.

### Step 4: Create the Makefile (Makefile)

Create a file named "Makefile" in the "pg_py_ext" directory with the following content:

```makefile
# Makefile for pg_py_ext
EXTENSION = pg_py_ext
DATA = pg_py_ext--1.0.sql

PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
```

- For more information on the Makefiles, you can refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation on makefile](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/extend-pgxs.html).

#### Explanation of the Makefile:
- `EXTENSION = pg_py_ext`: This variable specifies the name of the extension.
- `DATA = pg_py_ext--1.0.sql`: This variable includes the SQL script file ("pg_py_ext--1.0.sql") in the extension.
- `PG_CONFIG = pg_config`: This variable points to the `pg_config` executable, which is used to get PostgreSQL build information.
- `include $(PGXS)`: This includes the PostgreSQL Extension Makefile infrastructure.

### Step 5: Build and Install the Extension

Now, let's build and install the "pg_py_ext" extension:

```bash
# Build the extension
make

# Install the extension
make install
```

- For more information on the installation procedures, you can refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation on Installing the Files](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-procedure.html#INSTALL).

### Step 6: Enable the Extension in PostgreSQL

Connect to your PostgreSQL database using `psql`:

```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database
```

Inside the PostgreSQL interactive terminal, enable the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_py_ext;
```
- For more information on the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, you can refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation on `CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html).
Â 
### Step 7: Test the Extension

Now that the extension is enabled, you can use the `add_numbers` function in SQL queries:

```sql
-- Example usage of the function
SELECT add_numbers(3, 5);

-- Output:
 add_numbers
-------------
           8
(1 row)
```
