## What is a Makefile?

A Makefile is a build automation tool that can help you compile, link, and package your code. Makefiles typically consist of a set of rules that describe how to build different components of your software.

In the context of a PostgreSQL extension, a Makefile should describe how to build and install the extension, as well as any other components required for the extension to function.
## How to Write a Makefile for a PostgreSQL Extension

Here's an example Makefile for a simple PostgreSQL extension written in C:

```makefile

MODULES = myextension
DATA = myextension--1.0.sql
PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)

all: myextension.so

myextension.so: myextension.o
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LIBS)

myextension.o: myextension.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

install: all
        $(PGXS) install

uninstall:
        $(PGXS) uninstall
```



Let's break down each part of this Makefile: 
- `MODULES`: This variable lists the names of the C source files that should be compiled to create the extension. 
- `DATA`: This variable lists the SQL scripts that should be installed along with the extension. 
- `PG_CONFIG`: This variable specifies the location of the `pg_config` utility, which is used to determine the location of the PostgreSQL installation and other configuration options. 
- `PGXS`: This variable uses `pg_config` to determine the location of the PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure (PGXS), which contains the rules for building PostgreSQL extensions. 
- `include $(PGXS)`: This line includes the PGXS rules in the Makefile. 
- `all`: This target is the default target, which builds the extension. 
- `myextension.so`: This target specifies the name of the shared object file that should be created when the extension is built. The target depends on `myextension.o`, which contains the compiled C code for the extension. 
- `myextension.o`: This target specifies how to compile the C code for the extension. 
- `install`: This target installs the extension into the PostgreSQL installation directory. 
- `uninstall`: This target uninstalls the extension from the PostgreSQL installation directory.

To build and install the extension, simply run the following commands in the directory containing the Makefile:

```go

$ make
$ make install
```
