<h2>What is PGXN?</h2>
<p>PGXN stands for "PostgreSQL Extension Network". It is a community-driven repository of PostgreSQL extensions that makes it easy to discover, download, and install extensions for your PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>PGXN includes a web interface for browsing and searching extensions, as well as a command-line tool called <code><strong>pgxnclient</strong></code>&nbsp;for downloading and installing extensions.</p>
<h2>Do I Need PGXN?</h2>
<p>If you're building a PostgreSQL database and need to add functionality beyond what is included in the core PostgreSQL distribution, you may want to consider using PGXN to find and install extensions.</p>
<p>PGXN provides a convenient and centralized repository of PostgreSQL extensions, making it easy to discover and download the extensions you need. However, if you're already familiar with a specific extension and know where to find it, you may not need to use PGXN.</p>
<h2>How Does PGXN Work?</h2>
<p>To use PGXN, you'll need to install the&nbsp;<code><strong>pgxnclient</strong></code>&nbsp;command-line tool. You can do this using the following command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<code>
<p><em>$ sudo apt-get install pgxnclient # for Debian/Ubuntu</em></p>
<p><em>$ sudo yum install pgxnclient # for CentOS/Fedora</em></p>
</code>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have&nbsp;<code><strong>pgxnclient&nbsp;</strong></code>installed, you can use it to search for and download extensions. For example, to search for extensions related to JSON, you can use the following command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<code>
<p><em>$ pgxnclient search json</em></p>
</code>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will return a list of extensions related to JSON. You can then use the&nbsp;<code><strong>install</strong></code>&nbsp;command to download and install an extension. For example, to install the&nbsp;<code><strong>pgjwt&nbsp;</strong></code>extension for working with JSON Web Tokens, you can use the following command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<code>
<p><em>$ pgxnclient install pgjwt</em></p>
</code>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will download and install the&nbsp;<strong>pgjwt</strong>&nbsp;extension, making it available for use in your PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>Once you've installed an extension, you can load it into your database using the&nbsp;<code><strong>CREATE EXTENSION</strong></code> command. For example, to load the&nbsp;<code><strong>pgjwt</strong></code>&nbsp;extension, you can use the following SQL command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<code>
<p><em>CREATE EXTENSION pgjwt;</em></p>
</code>
