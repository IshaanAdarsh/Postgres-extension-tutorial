PostgreSQL supports several procedural languages that can be used in extension creation. Here are some of the commonly used procedural languages:

1.  **PL/pgSQL**: PL/pgSQL is the default procedural language in PostgreSQL. It is similar to SQL and provides additional control structures, variables, and exception handling. PL/pgSQL is widely used for writing stored procedures, triggers, and functions.

2.  **PL/Python**: PL/Python allows you to write PostgreSQL functions and procedures in the Python programming language. It provides full access to Python's extensive libraries and ecosystem, making it a popular choice for complex data processing and analytics tasks.

3.  **PL/Perl**: PL/Perl enables writing PostgreSQL functions and triggers in the Perl programming language. It allows you to leverage Perl's powerful text manipulation, regular expressions, and database connectivity capabilities.

4.  **PL/Java**: PL/Java allows you to write functions and procedures in the Java programming language. It provides seamless integration with Java code and enables the use of Java libraries and frameworks within PostgreSQL.

5.  **PL/PHP**: PL/PHP enables writing PostgreSQL functions and triggers in the PHP programming language. It provides a convenient way to incorporate PHP code into the database and interact with external web services or perform complex data manipulations.

6.  **PL/Lua**: PL/Lua allows you to write PostgreSQL functions and triggers using the Lua scripting language. Lua is known for its lightweight and embeddable nature, making it suitable for scripting and extension development.

7.  **PL/R**: PL/R enables writing PostgreSQL functions and procedures using the R programming language. It provides access to R's powerful statistical and data analysis capabilities, making it a preferred choice for advanced analytics within the database.

8.  **PL/sh**: PL/sh allows you to write PostgreSQL functions and triggers using shell scripting languages like Bash or Perl. It provides flexibility in integrating with external systems, executing system commands, and performing system-level operations.

9.  **PL/JavaScript**: PL/JavaScript allows you to write PostgreSQL functions and procedures using JavaScript. It leverages the V8 JavaScript engine for efficient execution and enables the use of JavaScript libraries and frameworks within PostgreSQL.

10. **PL/Python3** (Python 3 version of PL/Python)

11. **PL/Proxy**

12. **PL/v8** (JavaScript with V8 engine)

14. **PL/Perl6**

15. **PL/nodes**

16. **PL/SQL** (Oracle-compatible PL/SQL dialect)

17. **PL/TSQL** (Transact-SQL dialect)

18. **PL/LSM** (Log-Structured Merge Trees)

19. **PL/Tcl**
