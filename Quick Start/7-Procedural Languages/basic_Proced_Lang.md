Procedural Languages in PostgreSQL are programming languages that can be used to write stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers within the database. These languages extend the functionality of PostgreSQL by allowing developers to write custom code in languages other than SQL.

Procedural Languages offer several benefits:

1.  **Expanded Functionality**: By using procedural languages, developers can write complex logic and algorithms that go beyond the capabilities of SQL. Procedural languages provide features like loops, conditionals, exception handling, and advanced data manipulation, allowing for more powerful and flexible database programming.
    
2.  **Code Reusability**: Procedural languages allow developers to reuse existing code and libraries written in those languages. This enables integration with external systems, leveraging the vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available in popular programming languages.
    
3.  **Performance Optimization**: Procedural languages can provide performance optimizations by allowing developers to write highly optimized code in low-level languages like C or C++. This can be crucial for computationally intensive operations where performance is critical.
    
4.  **Domain-Specific Extensions**: Procedural languages enable the development of domain-specific extensions tailored to specific application needs. These extensions can encapsulate complex business logic, algorithms, or data processing routines, providing a higher level of abstraction and ease of use.
    

To use a procedural language in a PostgreSQL extension, you need to define and implement the language handler functions and register the language with PostgreSQL. Here's an example using the popular procedural language PL/Python:

1.  **Define the Language Handler Functions**: Create a code file, let's say `plpythonu.c`, containing the implementation of the PL/Python language handler functions. These functions define how PostgreSQL interacts with the Python interpreter. Here's a simplified example:
    
    ```c
    #include "postgres.h"
    #include "fmgr.h"
    #include "plpython.h"
    
    PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
    
    /* Entry point when the language is trusted */
    void _PG_init(void);
    
    /* Entry point when the language is untrusted */
    void _PG_init(void) {
        /* Register the PL/Python language */
        if (!PLy_init())
            elog(ERROR, "could not initialize PL/Python");
    }
    ```
    
    This code sets up the initialization function `_PG_init`, which registers the PL/Python language with PostgreSQL.
    
2.  **Build and Install the Extension**: In the Makefile, add the necessary rules to build and install the extension. Ensure that the procedural language files (`plpythonu.c` in this case) are compiled and linked properly. Here's an example snippet:
    
    ```makefile
    MODULES = my_extension
    DATA = my_extension--1.0.sql
    DOCS = README.md
    
    PG_CONFIG = pg_config
    PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
    include $(PGXS)
    ```
    
    This Makefile snippet ensures that the procedural language files are included in the build process and installed correctly with the extension.
    
3.  **Register the Language in SQL Script**: In the SQL script file (`my_extension--1.0.sql`), include the necessary SQL statements to register the procedural language. Here's an example:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE 'plpythonu' HANDLER plpython_call_handler;
    ```
    
    This statement registers the PL/Python procedural language with the `plpython_call_handler` function as the handler.
    
4.  **Build and Install the Extension**: Use the Makefile to build and install the extension:
    
    ```bash
    $ make
    $ make install
    ```
    
    This compiles the code, builds the extension, and installs it in the appropriate PostgreSQL directories.
    
5.  **Create and Use Functions in the Procedural Language**: After the extension is installed, you can create functions using the procedural language in your database. For example, to create a PL/Python function:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE FUNCTION my_python_function() RETURNS text AS $$
    def my_python_function():
        return 'Hello, PL/Python!'
    $$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;
    ```
    
    This creates a function named `my_python_function` that returns a text value. The function is written in PL/Python.
    

Procedural Languages provide a powerful way to extend PostgreSQL and leverage the capabilities of other programming languages within the database. They enable developers to write custom code, reuse existing libraries, optimize performance, and build domain-specific extensions tailored to their application requirements.
