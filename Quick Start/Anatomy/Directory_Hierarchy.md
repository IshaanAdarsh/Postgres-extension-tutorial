# Postgres Documentation:
The official PostgreSQL documentation does not specify a specific directory hierarchy for extension development. However, it provides recommendations and guidelines on organizing the files and directories within an extension.

According to the PostgreSQL documentation, the extension's files should be organized in a logical manner, making it easy to understand and maintain the codebase. 
- It suggests placing the SQL script files in a separate directory and using a consistent naming convention for those files. 
- It also recommends using a control file to provide metadata and configuration information about the extension.
- The documentation also mentions that the C source files for the extension should be organized in a way that aligns with the standard PostgreSQL extension building process, typically using the src/ directory and subdirectories for different modules or components.

It emphasizes the importance of clarity, maintainability, and adherence to PostgreSQL extension development practices. Therefore, you have the flexibility to choose a directory structure that best suits your extension's requirements while following the guidelines and recommendations outlined in the documentation.

# Proposed Changes:
When creating a directory structure for a PostgreSQL extension, there are various approaches you can take depending on the complexity and requirements of your extension. Here are three commonly used directory structures for PostgreSQL extensions:

1.  Simple Extension Structure: In this structure, the extension consists of a single SQL file and a control file. It is suitable for small, simple extensions with a few functions or objects.
    
    ```
    my_extension/
    ├── my_extension.sql
    └── my_extension.control
    
    ```
    
    The SQL file contains the extension's SQL statements and functions, while the control file provides metadata and configuration information about the extension.
    
2.  Modular Extension Structure: This structure is suitable for extensions with multiple components or modules. It organizes the code into separate directories based on functionality, making it easier to manage and maintain.
    
    ```css
    my_extension/
    ├── sql/
    │   ├── module1.sql
    │   ├── module2.sql
    │   └── ...
    ├── src/
    │   ├── module1/
    │   │   ├── module1.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── module2/
    │   │   ├── module2.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── my_extension.control
    └── Makefile
    
    ```
    
    In this structure, the SQL files are organized under the `sql/` directory, while the C source files for each module are placed in separate subdirectories under the `src/` directory. The `Makefile` handles the compilation and installation of the extension.
    
3.  Advanced Extension Structure: This structure is suitable for large and complex extensions that require additional organization and separation of code and resources.
    
    ```arduino
    my_extension/
    ├── sql/
    │   ├── module1.sql
    │   ├── module2.sql
    │   └── ...
    ├── src/
    │   ├── module1/
    │   │   ├── module1.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── module2/
    │   │   ├── module2.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── data/
    │   ├── scripts/
    │   │   ├── install.sql
    │   │   └── uninstall.sql
    │   ├── config/
    │   │   ├── my_extension.conf
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── doc/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── user_guide.md
    │   └── ...
    ├── my_extension.control
    └── Makefile
    
    ```
    
    In this structure, additional directories are added to separate data files, configuration files, documentation, and other resources related to the extension. This helps keep the codebase organized and makes it easier to distribute and install the extension.
    

Remember that the choice of directory structure depends on the specific needs of your extension. It's important to keep the structure logical, maintainable, and consistent with PostgreSQL extension development practices.
