Defining best 3 types of Directory structures for a PostgreSQL extension

When creating a directory structure for a PostgreSQL extension, there are various approaches you can take depending on the complexity and requirements of your extension. Here are three commonly used directory structures for PostgreSQL extensions:

1.  Simple Extension Structure: In this structure, the extension consists of a single SQL file and a control file. It is suitable for small, simple extensions with a few functions or objects.
    
    ```
    my_extension/
    ├── my_extension.sql
    └── my_extension.control
    
    ```
    
    The SQL file contains the extension's SQL statements and functions, while the control file provides metadata and configuration information about the extension.
    
2.  Modular Extension Structure: This structure is suitable for extensions with multiple components or modules. It organizes the code into separate directories based on functionality, making it easier to manage and maintain.
    
    ```css
    my_extension/
    ├── sql/
    │   ├── module1.sql
    │   ├── module2.sql
    │   └── ...
    ├── src/
    │   ├── module1/
    │   │   ├── module1.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── module2/
    │   │   ├── module2.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── my_extension.control
    └── Makefile
    
    ```
    
    In this structure, the SQL files are organized under the `sql/` directory, while the C source files for each module are placed in separate subdirectories under the `src/` directory. The `Makefile` handles the compilation and installation of the extension.
    
3.  Advanced Extension Structure: This structure is suitable for large and complex extensions that require additional organization and separation of code and resources.
    
    ```arduino
    my_extension/
    ├── sql/
    │   ├── module1.sql
    │   ├── module2.sql
    │   └── ...
    ├── src/
    │   ├── module1/
    │   │   ├── module1.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── module2/
    │   │   ├── module2.c
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── data/
    │   ├── scripts/
    │   │   ├── install.sql
    │   │   └── uninstall.sql
    │   ├── config/
    │   │   ├── my_extension.conf
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── doc/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── user_guide.md
    │   └── ...
    ├── my_extension.control
    └── Makefile
    
    ```
    
    In this structure, additional directories are added to separate data files, configuration files, documentation, and other resources related to the extension. This helps keep the codebase organized and makes it easier to distribute and install the extension.
    

Remember that the choice of directory structure depends on the specific needs of your extension. It's important to keep the structure logical, maintainable, and consistent with PostgreSQL extension development practices.
