# Regression Test
- A regression test is a type of test performed on a PostgreSQL extension to ensure that it continues to function correctly after making changes or updates. It involves running a predefined set of test cases that cover various aspects of the extension's functionality. The purpose of regression testing is to identify any regression or unintended side effects that may have been introduced by recent modifications to the extension's code.

The role of regression testing in PostgreSQL extensions is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of the extension. Here are some key aspects of regression testing and its role:

1.  **Ensuring Correctness:** Regression tests verify that the existing functionality of the extension is not broken by new code changes. By running the same set of test cases before and after making modifications, regression tests can detect any deviations in the extension's behavior, such as incorrect results, unexpected errors, or performance issues.

2.  **Preventing Regression Issues:** Regression testing helps prevent the introduction of regression issues, which are defects or bugs that reappear after being previously fixed. When adding new features or modifying existing ones, there is a risk of unintentionally breaking other parts of the extension. Regression tests act as a safety net by catching these regressions early in the development process.

3.  **Maintaining Compatibility:** PostgreSQL undergoes regular updates and releases, including bug fixes and feature enhancements. Regression tests ensure that the extension remains compatible with different versions of PostgreSQL. By running the regression tests against different versions of the database, developers can identify any compatibility issues and make the necessary adjustments to ensure smooth integration.

4.  **Supporting Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD):** Regression tests are typically integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for PostgreSQL extensions. Whenever a code change is made, the regression test suite is executed automatically as part of the build and deployment process. This allows developers to catch any regressions quickly and prevents problematic code changes from being deployed to production environments.

5.  **Facilitating Refactoring and Refinement:** Regression tests provide confidence during refactoring or code refactoring processes. Refactoring involves restructuring the code to improve its readability, maintainability, or performance without altering its external behavior. By running regression tests after refactoring, developers can ensure that the code changes have not introduced any unintended consequences or regressions.

6.  **Enhancing Robustness:** Regression tests contribute to the overall robustness and reliability of the extension. By exercising various aspects of the extension's functionality through well-defined test cases, regression testing helps uncover edge cases, boundary conditions, and exceptional scenarios that may not be apparent during regular usage. This helps developers identify and address potential issues before they impact users in real-world scenarios.

In summary, regression testing plays a crucial role in PostgreSQL extensions by verifying the correctness, stability, and compatibility of the extension's functionality. It helps developers catch regressions, maintain compatibility with different PostgreSQL versions, support CI/CD practices, facilitate refactoring, and enhance the overall robustness of the extension. By investing in comprehensive regression testing, developers can ensure a high level of quality and reliability in their PostgreSQL extensions.

## Creating Regression Test:
When creating a PostgreSQL extension, writing regression tests is essential to ensure the correctness and stability of the extension's functionality. Here's a quick start guide on how to write regression tests for your extension:

1.  **Identify Test Scenarios:** Begin by identifying the different scenarios that need to be tested for your extension. Consider the various features, functions, and edge cases that your extension supports. This will help you determine the scope of your regression tests.

2.  **Create Test Cases:** For each identified scenario, create individual test cases that exercise the functionality of your extension. A test case typically consists of an SQL script that sets up the necessary database state, executes the extension's functions or features, and verifies the expected results.

3.  **Define Expected Results:** Clearly define the expected results for each test case. This includes the expected output, database changes, error messages, or any other relevant outcomes. Having well-defined expected results allows you to validate the behavior of your extension and detect any regressions.

4.  **Write SQL Scripts:** Write SQL scripts that represent your test cases. These scripts should include the necessary SQL statements to set up the test environment, invoke the extension's functions or features, and compare the actual results with the expected results.

5.  **Utilize Assertions:** In your SQL scripts, use assertions to compare the actual results with the expected results. Assertions help validate the correctness of your extension by ensuring that the output matches the expected outcome. PostgreSQL provides various assertion mechanisms, such as `ASSERT`, `ASSERT_EQUALS`, or `ASSERT_NOT_EQUALS`, to facilitate this comparison.

6.  **Handle Exceptions:** Consider including test cases that validate the behavior of your extension in exceptional scenarios, such as handling unexpected input, error conditions, or edge cases. These tests help uncover any issues related to error handling, data validation, or boundary conditions.

7.  **Organize Test Suite:** Organize your regression tests into a test suite for easier execution and maintenance. Group related test cases together, and use descriptive names for your test scripts to indicate their purpose or scenario being tested. This allows for better organization and scalability as your extension evolves.

8.  **Automate Testing:** Automate the execution of your regression tests to streamline the testing process. This can be achieved by integrating your test suite with a continuous integration (CI) system or using test frameworks specifically designed for PostgreSQL extensions, such as `pgTAP` or `pg_regress`. Automation enables you to run the regression tests regularly, catch regressions early, and ensure consistent testing across different environments.

9.  **Maintain and Update:** As your extension evolves, continue to maintain and update your regression tests. Whenever you make changes to the extension's code or add new features, ensure that the regression tests are updated accordingly to reflect the expected behavior.

Benefits for the Developer:

-   **Ensuring Correctness:** Regression tests provide confidence that your extension behaves correctly and consistently across different scenarios, preventing regressions and unintended side effects.

-   **Early Issue Detection:** By running regression tests regularly during development, you can catch issues early, enabling faster identification and resolution of problems before they impact users.

-   **Facilitating Refactoring and Maintenance:** Regression tests act as a safety net when refactoring or maintaining your extension's code. They help ensure that modifications do not introduce regressions and allow for easier identification of issues during code changes.

-   **Supporting Collaboration:** Regression tests serve as a form of documentation and provide a shared understanding of the expected behavior of your extension. They facilitate collaboration among team members, allowing others to understand and validate the extension's functionality.

-   **Streamlining Continuous Integration and Deployment:** By automating regression tests, you can seamlessly integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that any code changes are thoroughly tested and validated before deployment, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into production environments.
