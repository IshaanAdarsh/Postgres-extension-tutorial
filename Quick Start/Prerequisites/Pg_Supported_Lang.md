PostgreSQL supports various target languages for extension development. Here is a list of the supported target languages in Postgres Extension Creation:

1. **C:** The C programming language is widely used for developing PostgreSQL extensions. It offers direct access to PostgreSQL internals and provides high performance.
 - Development Environment: To develop C-based extensions for PostgreSQL, you need a C compiler (such as GCC) and the necessary development libraries for PostgreSQL. 
   - On Linux systems, you may need to install the `postgresql-server-dev` package. 
   - On macOS, you can use Xcode Command Line Tools or install PostgreSQL via Homebrew. 
   - On Windows, you can use Microsoft Visual Studio or MinGW.
 - Build System: C-based extensions typically use Makefiles or build systems like CMake or Autotools to compile and link the extension code.

2. **C++:** PostgreSQL also supports C++ for extension development. C++ allows object-oriented programming and provides additional features over the C language.
 - Development Environment: Similar to C, you need a C++ compiler and the development libraries for PostgreSQL.
 - Build System: C++ extensions can use Makefiles or build systems like CMake or Autotools for compilation and linking.

3. **PL/pgSQL:** PL/pgSQL is the default procedural language of PostgreSQL. It is similar to SQL and allows you to write stored procedures, functions, and triggers using SQL-like syntax.
 - Development Environment: PL/pgSQL is a procedural language built into PostgreSQL, so no additional development environment is required. You can write PL/pgSQL functions directly in the PostgreSQL database using SQL client tools.

4. **SQL:** PostgreSQL extensions can be created using pure SQL. SQL-based extensions are useful for defining data structures, views, and other database objects.
 - Development Environment: SQL-based extensions are written directly in SQL and can be created using any SQL client tool or command-line interface that can connect to PostgreSQL.

5. **Python:** PostgreSQL has excellent support for the Python programming language. The `plpython` extension enables you to write extension functions using Python. Python is known for its simplicity and readability.
 - Development Environment: For Python-based extensions, you need a Python interpreter and the `psycopg2` library for connecting to PostgreSQL. You can install the required packages using `pip`.
 - Editor/IDE: You can use any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice for writing Python code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and Sublime Text.

6. **Perl:** Perl is a powerful scripting language, and PostgreSQL provides the `plperl` extension for writing extension functions in Perl. Perl offers rich text-processing capabilities and is well-suited for tasks involving regular expressions and text manipulation.
 - Development Environment: For Perl-based extensions, you need a Perl interpreter and the `DBD::Pg` module for PostgreSQL connectivity. You can install the required modules using `cpan` or your system's package manager.
 - Editor/IDE: Any text editor or Perl-friendly IDE like Padre or Komodo can be used for writing Perl code.

7. **Ruby:** PostgreSQL supports Ruby through the `plruby` extension. Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented language known for its concise syntax and expressiveness.
 - Development Environment: Ruby-based extensions require a Ruby interpreter and the `pg` gem for PostgreSQL connectivity. You can install the necessary gems using `gem`.
 - Editor/IDE: Popular text editors like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Ruby-specific IDEs like RubyMine are suitable for writing Ruby code.

8. **Java:** PostgreSQL provides the `pljava` extension, which allows you to write extension functions in Java. Java is a widely used language in enterprise environments, and PL/Java enables seamless integration with PostgreSQL.
 - Development Environment: Java-based extensions require a Java Development Kit (JDK) and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. You can set up your Java development environment by installing the JDK and adding the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to your project.
 - IDE: Java can be developed using IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.

9. **JavaScript:** PostgreSQL supports JavaScript through the `plv8` extension. It allows you to write extension functions using JavaScript, leveraging the power of JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
 - Development Environment: JavaScript-based extensions using the `plv8` extension require the V8 JavaScript engine and the necessary development libraries. The `plv8` extension provides installation instructions for the required dependencies.
 - Editor/IDE: Any text editor or JavaScript-specific IDE like Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or Atom can be used for writing JavaScript code.

10. **R:** The `plr` extension enables the use of the R programming language in PostgreSQL. R is popular among data scientists and statisticians for data analysis and statistical modeling.
 - Development Environment: R-based extensions require the R programming language and the `RPostgreSQL` package for PostgreSQL connectivity. You can install the necessary packages using the `install.packages()` function in R.
 - Editor/IDE: R can be written using any text editor or specialized IDEs like RStudio or Jupyter Notebook.
