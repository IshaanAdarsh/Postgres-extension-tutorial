PostgreSQL supports various target languages for extension development. Here is a list of the supported target languages in Postgres Extension Creation:

1. **C:** The C programming language is widely used for developing PostgreSQL extensions. It offers direct access to PostgreSQL internals and provides high performance.

2. **C++:** PostgreSQL also supports C++ for extension development. C++ allows object-oriented programming and provides additional features over the C language.

3. **PL/pgSQL:** PL/pgSQL is the default procedural language of PostgreSQL. It is similar to SQL and allows you to write stored procedures, functions, and triggers using SQL-like syntax.

4. **SQL:** PostgreSQL extensions can be created using pure SQL. SQL-based extensions are useful for defining data structures, views, and other database objects.

5. **Python:** PostgreSQL has excellent support for the Python programming language. The `plpython` extension enables you to write extension functions using Python. Python is known for its simplicity and readability.

6. **Perl:** Perl is a powerful scripting language, and PostgreSQL provides the `plperl` extension for writing extension functions in Perl. Perl offers rich text-processing capabilities and is well-suited for tasks involving regular expressions and text manipulation.

7. **Ruby:** PostgreSQL supports Ruby through the `plruby` extension. Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented language known for its concise syntax and expressiveness.

8. **Java:** PostgreSQL provides the `pljava` extension, which allows you to write extension functions in Java. Java is a widely used language in enterprise environments, and PL/Java enables seamless integration with PostgreSQL.

9. **JavaScript:** PostgreSQL supports JavaScript through the `plv8` extension. It allows you to write extension functions using JavaScript, leveraging the power of JavaScript frameworks and libraries.

10. **R:** The `plr` extension enables the use of the R programming language in PostgreSQL. R is popular among data scientists and statisticians for data analysis and statistical modeling.
